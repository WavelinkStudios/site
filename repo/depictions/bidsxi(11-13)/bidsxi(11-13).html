    <p>This app allows you to see the Bundle ID's of all the applications installed on your device. <br><br>
      This app was originally by @NoahSaso. Sadly it appears that he has since gone inactive around late 2017 and the app was only ever compiled for 32-bit devices. I figured this would be a relatively easy first attempt at jailbreak projects seeing as I have never really worked in this scene but have a little bit of coding knowledge from other types of small personal projects. <br><br>
      This project would not be where it is today without all of the amazing help from @Skittyblock, @TheTomMetzger, @EthanWhited, @MTAC8, and @xerusdesign.<br><br>
      Skitty and Tom both helped me get BundleIDsXI up and running for when iOS 11 was finally jailbroken.<br><br>
      MTAC8 helped me get BundleIDsXI up and running without app icons initially for iOS 13 to combat an issue with Ryan Petrich's AppList when iOS 13 was first jailbroken.<br><br>
      Ethan helped get the iOS 13 update working with app icons still using Ryan Petrich's AppList for iOS 13.<br><br>
      Xerus made the amazing new icon for BundleIDsXI when it first came out and the same one we still use today.<br><br>
      Staying true to the original project, I have made my update open source for all to take a look at and even help me learn by helping me update the app further. You can check out my fork of the app on my GitHub page.
