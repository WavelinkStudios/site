    <p>This app allows you to see the Bundle ID's of all the applications installed on your device. <br><br>
    A huge thanks to @MTAC8 for helping make this version possible. Due to the way that iOS 13 has changed the springboard and the way that Ryan Petrich's AppList pulls icons in the latest build at this point in time, the app crashes at launch for iOS 13 devices. To combat this I have removed the app icons from the list view of the app. If you have iOS 11-12 then you are more than able to use the normal version of the app as this update only has changes for iOS 13 devices.<br><br>
    This app was originally by @NoahSaso. Sadly it appears that he has since gone inactive around late 2017 and the app was only ever compiled for 32-bit devices. I figured this would be a relatively easy first attempt at jailbreak projects seeing as I have never really worked in this scene but have a little bit of coding knowledge from other types of small personal projects. <br><br>
    An absolutely HUGE thanks to @Skittyblock and @TheTomMetzger for all of their help in getting this update working and tested. I hope you all enjoy it even though it is a relatively small project. And finally a huge thanks to @xerusdesign for making the amazing new icon. Staying true to the original project, I have made my update open source for all to take a look at and even help me learn by helping me update the app further. You can check out my fork of the app at the link on the bottom of the page. <br><br>
